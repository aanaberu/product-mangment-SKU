## What is SKU?

In product management, an SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is a unique identifier used to track and manage individual products or services within a company. It is commonly used in inventory and sales systems to differentiate products based on attributes such as size, color, or model.

### Key Aspects of SKUs in Product Management

1. **Unique Identifier**: Each SKU is unique and helps distinguish between different products or variants of the same product.
2. **Attributes**: SKUs often encode information about the product, such as category, type, version, and other differentiators. For example, an SKU for a blue t-shirt in size medium might look like `TSH-BL-M`.
3. **Inventory Tracking**: SKUs enable efficient inventory management by tracking stock levels, sales, and restocking needs.
4. **Sales Analysis**: By analyzing SKU-level data, product managers can identify high- and low-performing products.
5. **Customer Experience**: SKUs ensure accurate fulfillment of customer orders, reducing errors in shipping the wrong product.
